# Esp8266-Kitchen-Counter-Lights

A project for controlling 12V LED strip using an ESP8266. Also a project so my girlfriend doesn't kill me.

**Implemented Features:**

- Rotary encoder switch toggles the LEDs
- Rotary encoder adjusts the brightness of the LEDs


<br />

**Future Features:**

- Webpage for control via WiFi
- Adding Amazon Alexa support

## Parts

I'm using the following parts for this project

- [Wemos D1 Mini*](http://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/uzFUnIe) - any ESP8266 dev board will work
- [12V LED Light Strip*](http://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/BIAa6qR) - I bought the warm white waterproof one
- [IRLB8721 Mosfet*](http://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/nUfiUfU)
- [Rotary Encoder Module*](http://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/MvznYFy)
- [12V Power Supply*](http://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/aiYnIyf) - I got a 2A one, but for 2M of LED I probably could have used a 1A
- [DC-DC Buck Converter*](http://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/BmEamee)
- [Some 2.1mm DC Jacks and sockets*](http://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/ZnMV7AI) - You could connect the LED strips without these though
